# ALU_with_testBenches_vhdl
A VHDL-based 8-bit ALU supporting RISC-V-style operations including arithmetic, logic, and shift instructions. Includes a randomized, self-checking testbench that verifies ALU correctness over 5000+ test cases using a golden model. Signals are validated per cycle, and pass/fail counters are maintained per operation. Tool: Vivado

## Testbench Strategy
Multiple testing approaches were used to validate the ALU:
- **Unit testbenches**: Verified individual operations (e.g., ADD, SUB, SLL) with fixed input vectors and edge cases
- **Randomized testing**: Generated 5000+ randomized test cases across all operations using `uniform()` and golden reference models
- **Self-checking logic**: Expected results and flags are calculated internally and compared per test
- **Per-operation counters**: Failures are tracked by operation to help isolate bugs and validate coverage

## Key Learnings

- Handling signed and unsigned arithmetic in VHDL
- Managing timing between signals vs. variables
- Ensuring valid test coverage through randomized simulations
- Using `math_real.uniform()` for input generation
- Tracking and summarizing pass/fail data per operation

## 📸 Simulation Results

**5000/5000** randomized test cases passed

### Tcl Console Output
This shows the final test summary from the randomized testbench:

### Waveform Example

## How to Run

1. Launch **Vivado 2024.2**
2. Open the project or create a new one and add the files from the `src/` and `test_benches/` folder.
    For the test_benches, you can choose any of the test_bench code that have ALU to test the functionality of the ALU.
3. Set `tb_ALU_rand.vhd` as the top simulation unit
4. Go to **Flow → Run Simulation → Run Behavioral Simulation** or 
    in the **project manager, you can directly click the run simulation -> Run Behavioral Simulation**.
    **Note:** For the randomized testing, the simulation runtime need to be adjusted based on the number of tests.
    Click the in the project manager, click the **Simulation -> simulation settings** then, in the lower right,
    there are COMPILATION | ELABORATION | SIMULATION | and so on, click the **Simulation -> xsim.simulate.runtime** modify the value.
5. Open the **Waveform Viewer** to inspect signal transitions and flags
6. View the test results in the **Tcl Console**
