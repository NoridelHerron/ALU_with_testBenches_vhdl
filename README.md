# ALU_with_testBenches_vhdl
A VHDL-based 8-bit ALU supporting RISC-V-style operations including arithmetic, logic, and shift instructions. Includes a randomized, self-checking testbench that verifies ALU correctness over 5000+ test cases using a golden model. Signals are validated per cycle, and pass/fail counters are maintained per operation. Tool: Vivado
